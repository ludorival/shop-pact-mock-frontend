## Motivation: Why Leverage Existing Mocks? 🤔

### The Problem with Traditional Contract Testing

Contract testing with Pact is a powerful technique for ensuring compatibility between services in a microservices architecture. However, it often comes with a significant challenge: **developers need to write additional tests** to generate consumer contracts. And let's be honest, who has time for that? 😅

Consider the typical workflow (and why it's a bit of a pain):
1. Developers write integration tests using mocks (e.g., `cy.intercept()` in Cypress, Mockito/MockK in Java/Kotlin, MSW in React)
2. To add contract testing, they must write **separate** Pact consumer tests (ugh, more code to maintain!)
3. This results in duplicate test code, maintaining two sets of mocks, and increased development time (because we all love maintaining duplicate code, right? 🙄)

Many developers are hesitant to adopt contract testing because:
- **Extra work**: Writing and maintaining additional tests feels like overhead (we're already busy enough!)
- **Code duplication**: The same mock data exists in multiple places (DRY? What's that?)
- **Time constraints**: Teams prioritize feature development over additional test infrastructure (shipping features > writing more tests)
- **Complexity**: Learning Pact's DSL adds cognitive load (another thing to learn? No thanks!)

### The Solution: Leverage Existing Mocks ✨

Instead of writing new tests, what if we could **automatically generate Pact contracts from the mocks we're already using**? Sounds like magic, right? Well, it kind of is! 🪄 This approach offers several benefits:

1. **Zero additional test code**: Your existing tests become contract tests automatically (no extra work, just pure win!)
2. **Single source of truth**: Mocks are defined once, contracts are generated from them (DRY principle, finally!)
3. **Gradual adoption**: Start with existing tests, expand coverage over time (no need to rewrite everything at once)
4. **Developer-friendly**: No need to learn Pact DSL; use familiar mocking libraries (use what you already know!)
5. **Reduced maintenance**: Changes to mocks automatically update contracts (one less thing to worry about)

### How It Works 🛠️

By using libraries like [`pact-js-mock`](https://github.com/ludorival/pact-js-mock) for frontend applications and [`pact-jvm-mock`](https://github.com/ludorival/pact-jvm-mock) for JVM-based backends, we can:

- **Frontend**: Convert Cypress `cy.intercept()` calls or MSW handlers `http.get()` into Pact contracts (just swap a few method names!)
- **Backend**: Convert Mockito or MockK mocks (with Spring RestTemplate) into Pact contracts (your existing tests are already 90% there!)

This tutorial demonstrates how to transform your existing test mocks into comprehensive Pact contracts with minimal changes to your codebase.

## 🚀 Quick Start: Use AI to Generate Your Contract Tests

> **For developers who want to jump straight to implementation**: Use the AI prompts below with GitHub Copilot, Cursor, or other AI coding assistants to automatically convert your existing mocks into Pact contracts. Skip to the detailed steps later if you need more context.

### AI Prompt for Frontend Contract Tests

**Use this prompt in your AI agent (Copilot, Cursor, etc.) to automatically detect your stack and convert existing mocks to Pact contracts:**

```
I want to convert my existing frontend test mocks to generate Pact consumer contracts using pact-js-mock. Please analyze my codebase and apply the appropriate approach based on what you find.

First, please:
1. Analyze the codebase to determine:
   - Does it use Cypress for testing? (look for cypress.config.ts, cy.intercept() calls, or Cypress test files)
   - Does it use MSW (Mock Service Worker)? (look for msw imports, setupServer, http.get(), or graphql.query() calls)
   - If using MSW, is it for REST APIs or GraphQL? (check for http.* vs graphql.* handlers)
   - What testing framework is used? (Jest, Mocha, Vitest, etc.)
   - What is the consumer name? (infer from package.json name or project structure)

2. Install the pact-js-mock npm dependency and then read the README from the installed package to understand the setup requirements.

3. Based on your analysis and the README documentation, apply the appropriate setup:
   
   **If Cypress is detected:**
   - Register the pact-js-mock plugin in cypress.config.ts (or cypress/plugins/index.js)
   - Add the Cypress support import to cypress/support/component.ts or cypress/support/e2e.ts
   - Convert all cy.intercept() calls to cy.pactIntercept() calls
   - Ensure provider names are inferred from URL patterns
   
   **If MSW is detected:**
   - Replace MSW's `http` with `pactHttp` from 'pact-js-mock/lib/msw'
   - Replace MSW's `graphql` with `pactGraphql` from 'pact-js-mock/lib/msw' (if GraphQL)
   - Add the required lifecycle hooks (deletePacts, reloadPacts, writePacts, setCurrentSourceForPacts) based on the test framework
   - Ensure handlers are properly set up with the pact registry

4. Run the build to ensure no regression:
   - Execute the build command (e.g., `npm run build` or `npm run build:test`)
   - Verify that the build completes successfully without errors
   - Confirm that existing functionality is not broken by the setup changes

5. Run the tests to verify contract generation:
   - Execute the test command (e.g., `npm test` or `npm run test`)
   - Verify that all tests pass successfully
   - Confirm that Pact contracts are generated in the expected location (typically `pacts/` directory)
   - Check that the generated contract files contain the expected interactions

6. Add npm scripts for publishing contracts to Pact Broker:
   - pact:publish: publish contracts to the broker
   - pact:can-i-deploy: check deployment compatibility

7. Analyze and update CI/CD pipeline:
   - Detect existing CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps, CircleCI, etc.)
   - Ask for Pact Broker URL if not found in environment variables or configuration
   - Ask for Pact Broker token if authentication is required
   - Add/modify pipeline steps to:
     * Run tests to generate contracts
     * Publish contracts to Pact Broker after successful tests (using PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL and PACT_BROKER_TOKEN)
     * Optionally add pact:can-i-deploy check before deployment
   - Use GIT_COMMIT or equivalent for contract versioning

8. Ensure all changes maintain existing test behavior while generating Pact contracts automatically.

9. Publish contracts and prepare for provider verification:
   - Ensure the build and tests run successfully
   - Verify that Pact contracts are generated in the expected location (typically `pacts/` directory)
   - Publish contracts to the Pact Broker using the publish script (this makes contracts available for provider verification)
   - Verify contracts are visible in the Pact Broker UI
   - Document the following information needed for the provider verification step:
     * Consumer name (used to identify which contracts the provider needs to verify)
     * Provider name (the service that will verify the contracts)
     * Pact Broker URL and authentication token (required for provider to fetch contracts)
     * Contract version/GIT_COMMIT (used for versioning and tracking)
   - Prepare guidance for the provider team to implement verification tests that will:
     * Fetch contracts from the Pact Broker
     * Verify the provider service satisfies all consumer contracts
     * Publish verification results back to the Pact Broker
```

### AI Prompt for Backend Contract Tests (JVM)

**Use this prompt in your AI agent to automatically detect your stack and convert existing mocks to Pact contracts:**

```
I want to convert my existing JVM backend test mocks to generate Pact consumer contracts using pact-jvm-mock. Please analyze my codebase and apply the appropriate approach based on what you find.

First, please:
1. Analyze the codebase to determine:
   - What build tool is used? (Maven with pom.xml or Gradle with build.gradle/build.gradle.kts)
   - What mocking framework is used? (Mockito with `when().thenReturn()` or MockK with `every { }.returns()`)
   - What language is used? (Java or Kotlin)
   - What HTTP client is used for external calls? (Spring RestTemplate, WebClient, OkHttp, etc.)
   - What external services are called? (infer provider names from URLs or service names)
   - What is the consumer name? (infer from project name, artifactId, or application name)
   - Where are the integration tests located? (src/test/java or src/test/kotlin)
   - What testing framework is used? (JUnit 4, JUnit 5, TestNG, etc.)

2. Access the pact-jvm-mock README from https://github.com/ludorival/pact-jvm-mock to understand the setup requirements. If you cannot access the README remotely, please ask me to provide a copy of it.

3. Based on your analysis and the README documentation, apply the appropriate setup:
   
   **Dependencies:**
   - Add the appropriate pact-jvm-mock dependency based on mocking framework:
     * For Mockito: `pact-jvm-mock-mockito`
     * For MockK: `pact-jvm-mock-mockk`
   - Add `pact-jvm-mock-spring` if using Spring RestTemplate
   - Add dependencies to the correct build file (pom.xml or build.gradle/build.gradle.kts)
   
   **Configuration:**
   - Create a PactConfiguration object/class for each external service provider
   - Use SpringRestTemplateMockAdapter if Spring RestTemplate is detected
   - Infer provider names from service URLs or existing test structure
   - Infer consumer name from project configuration
   
   **Test Conversion:**
   - Annotate test class with `@EnablePactMock(PactConfiguration::class)` for Kotlin or `@EnablePactMock(PactConfiguration.class)` for Java
   - For Mockito: Import `io.github.ludorival.pactjvm.mock.mockito.EnablePactMock` and replace `Mockito.when()` with `PactMockito.uponReceiving()`
   - For MockK: Import `io.github.ludorival.pactjvm.mock.mockk.EnablePactMock` and replace `every { }` with `uponReceiving { }`
   - Ensure all existing test assertions remain unchanged
   - Preserve test structure and naming conventions

4. Add build tasks for publishing contracts to Pact Broker:
   - For Maven: Add pact:publish goal configuration
   - For Gradle: Add pactPublish task configuration
   - Configure Pact Broker URL and token via environment variables

5. Analyze and update CI/CD pipeline:
   - Detect existing CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps, CircleCI, etc.)
   - Ask for Pact Broker URL if not found in environment variables or configuration
   - Ask for Pact Broker token if authentication is required
   - Add/modify pipeline steps to:
     * Run tests to generate contracts (mvn test or ./gradlew test)
     * Publish contracts to Pact Broker after successful tests (mvn pact:publish or ./gradlew pactPublish)
     * Optionally add can-i-deploy check before deployment
   - Use GIT_COMMIT or equivalent for contract versioning
   - Ensure proper environment variables are set (PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL, PACT_BROKER_TOKEN, GIT_COMMIT)

6. Ensure all changes maintain existing test behavior while generating Pact contracts automatically in src/test/resources/pacts (default location).

7. Verify that everything works:
   - Ensure the build and tests run successfully
   - Verify that Pact contracts are generated in the expected location (typically `src/test/resources/pacts/` directory)
   - Provide a simple guide for publishing contracts to a Pact Broker, including:
     * How to set up PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL and PACT_BROKER_TOKEN environment variables
     * How to run the publish command locally (mvn pact:publish or ./gradlew pactPublish)
     * How the CI/CD pipeline will handle publishing automatically
     * How to customize interaction descriptions and provider states if needed
```

### AI Prompt for Provider Verification Tests (JVM)

**Use this prompt to create Pact provider verification tests and update CI/CD pipeline:**

```
I have a JVM application (Spring Boot, Micronaut, Quarkus, etc.) that acts as a provider in a Pact contract. I need to create a provider verification test and update my CI/CD pipeline.

First, please:
1. Analyze the codebase to determine:
   - What framework is used? (Spring Boot, Micronaut, Quarkus, etc.)
   - What build tool is used? (Maven with pom.xml or Gradle with build.gradle/build.gradle.kts)
   - What language is used? (Java or Kotlin)
   - What testing framework is used? (JUnit 4, JUnit 5, TestNG, etc.)
   - What port does the application run on? (infer from application.properties/yml or default)
   - What is the provider name? (infer from application name or project configuration)

2. Access the Pact JVM provider verification documentation from https://docs.pact.io/implementation_guides/jvm or the Pact JVM repository to understand provider verification setup. If you cannot access the documentation remotely, please ask me to provide relevant documentation or examples.

3. Create a provider verification test that:
   - Uses appropriate test annotations (@SpringBootTest, @MicronautTest, etc.) to start the application
   - Verifies all interactions from the Pact Broker
   - Uses @PactBroker annotation to fetch contracts from the broker
   - Configures the test to run against the running application
   - Publishes verification results back to the Pact Broker
   - For Spring Boot: Use @ExtendWith(PactVerificationInvocationContextProvider::class) and @SpringBootTest with webEnvironment = DEFINED_PORT

4. Analyze and update CI/CD pipeline:
   - Detect existing CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps, CircleCI, etc.)
   - Ask for Pact Broker URL if not found in environment variables or configuration
   - Ask for Pact Broker token if authentication is required
   - Add/modify pipeline steps to:
     * Run provider verification tests (mvn verify or ./gradlew test)
     * Ensure verification results are published back to the Pact Broker
     * Optionally add can-i-d$^
     `eploy check before deployment
   - Use GIT_COMMIT or equivalent for provider versioning
   - Ensure proper environment variables are set (PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL, PACT_BROKER_TOKEN, GIT_COMMIT)

5. Include all necessary dependencies:
   - For Spring Boot: au.com.dius.pact.provider:junit5 and au.com.dius.pact.provider:spring
   - For other frameworks: appropriate Pact provider dependencies

6. Verify that everything works:
   - Ensure the build and provider verification tests run successfully
   - Verify that verification results are published back to the Pact Broker
   - Provide a simple guide for running provider verification, including:
     * How to set up PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL and PACT_BROKER_TOKEN environment variables
     * How to run verification tests locally (mvn verify or ./gradlew test)
     * How the CI/CD pipeline will handle verification automatically
     * How to check verification results in the Pact Broker
```

### Benefits of Using AI Agents 🤖

Using AI agents with these prompts provides several advantages (because who doesn't love a good coding assistant?):

1. **Faster onboarding**: New team members can quickly understand and implement contract testing (no more "how do I do this again?" moments)
2. **Consistent patterns**: AI agents help maintain consistent test structure across the codebase (consistency is key, after all!)
3. **Reduced errors**: AI agents can catch common mistakes and suggest best practices 


**Note**: Always review AI-generated code and ensure it matches your project's standards and requirements. AI is smart, but you're smarter! 🧠

## Let's get started! 🎉

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to implement contract testing using Pact in a microservices architecture. Our example consists of three components (think of them as our test subjects):

- [`shop-frontend`](https://github.com/ludorival/shop-pact-mock-frontend): A web application with Cypress tests (the pretty face of our shop)
- [`order-service`](https://github.com/ludorival/order-service-pact-mock-demo): A Springboot application handling orders written in Kotlin and using MockK for mocking (the brain that processes orders)
- [`inventory-service`](https://github.com/ludorival/inventory-service-pact-mock-demo): Another Springboot application managing inventory written in Kotlin and also using MockK (the warehouse keeper)


These repositories will serve as the base code for this tutorial. We'll build step-by-step instructions on top of them, illustrating how to implement contract testing in real applications. No fake examples here - just real, working code! 💪

Before we dive into the architecture, let's see what we're building! Here's our shop-frontend in action:

![Shop Frontend Demo](src/new%20amazon.gif)

*Okay, okay, it's not about to replace Amazon, but you get the idea, right?* 😄🛒 As you can see, it's a simple e-commerce interface where users can browse products, add items to their cart, and place orders. Pretty standard stuff, but perfect for demonstrating contract testing in action!

Now, let's talk architecture. Our microservices setup follows a simple request flow:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[shop-frontend] --> B[order-service]
    B --> C[inventory-service]
```

Here's how it works: when a user interacts with the `shop-frontend` (like adding an item to cart or placing an order), it makes API calls to the `order-service`. The `order-service` then communicates with the `inventory-service` to check stock availability and update inventory levels. Each service has its own responsibilities, and they need to communicate seamlessly - which is exactly where contract testing comes in! 🎯

## Prerequisites 📋

Before we dive in, make sure you have:
- Node.js installed 
- Basic understanding of React and TypeScript 
- Docker for running Pact Broker (or use PactFlow if you prefer the managed route)

## 1. Deploy Pact Broker 🚀

First things first - we need somewhere to store our contracts! You have two options :

### Option A: Using PactFlow (Managed Service) ☁️

The easy way :
1. Create an account on [PactFlow](https://pactflow.io/) (it's free to start!)
2. Get your API token 
3. Set environment variables:
```bash
export PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL=https://your-org.pactflow.io
export PACT_BROKER_TOKEN=your-token
```


### Option B: Self-hosted with Docker 🐳

Want to run it yourself? No problem! For a complete self-hosted setup with PostgreSQL:

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL
docker run --name postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -e POSTGRES_DB=pact -d -p 5432:5432 postgres

# Start Pact Broker
docker run --name pact-broker \
  --link postgres:postgres \
  -e PACT_BROKER_DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:password@postgres/pact \
  -e PACT_BROKER_PORT=9292 \
  -d -p 9292:9292 \
  pactfoundation/pact-broker
```

Alternatively, use Docker Compose for easier management:

```yaml:docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: pact
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"

  pact-broker:
    image: pactfoundation/pact-broker
    ports:
      - "9292:9292"
    environment:
      PACT_BROKER_DATABASE_URL: postgres://postgres:password@postgres/pact
      PACT_BROKER_PORT: 9292
    depends_on:
      - postgres
```

Then run:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Access the Pact Broker at `http://localhost:9292` - open it in your browser and admire the empty broker 

## 2. Publish Contract between shop-frontend and order-service 🎯

TODO: point to the egenerated pull request done by AI agent
> **Reference Implementation**: See the complete working example in [shop-pact-mock-frontend](https://github.com/ludorival/shop-pact-mock-frontend)

Alright, time for the fun part! Let's make our frontend generate contracts. This is where the magic happens ✨

### Step 1: Install Dependencies 📦

First, let's get the tools we need. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install --save-dev pact-js-mock @pact-foundation/pact-cli
```

### Step 2: Setup Cypress Plugin ⚙️

Now let's configure Cypress to work with Pact. Update your `cypress.config.ts` to register the Pact plugin. For component tests, you need to add `setupNodeEvents` (don't worry, it's just a few lines):

```typescript:cypress.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "cypress";
import pactPlugin from 'pact-js-mock/lib/cypress/plugin';

export default defineConfig({
  component: {
    devServer: {
      framework: "react",
      bundler: "vite",
    },
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      return pactPlugin(on, config, {
        consumerName: 'shop-frontend',
        pactVersion: '4.0.0',
      });
    },
  },
});
```

**Note**: If you're using E2E tests instead of component tests, the structure is slightly different (but still super simple):

```typescript:cypress.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "cypress";
import pactPlugin from 'pact-js-mock/lib/cypress/plugin';

export default defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      return pactPlugin(on, config, {
        consumerName: 'shop-frontend',
        pactVersion: '4.0.0',
      });
    },
  },
});
```

### Step 3: Import Cypress Support 📥

Almost there! Add the Cypress support import to your support file (just one line, we promise):

```typescript:cypress/support/component.ts
import './commands'
import 'pact-js-mock/lib/cypress'

// ... rest of your support file
```

### Step 4: Convert Existing Mocks to Pact Intercepts 🔄

Here's where it gets exciting! Looking at our example code, we can see the frontend already has mocks in the Cypress tests using `cy.intercept()`:

```typescript:src/App.cy.tsx
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.intercept('GET', `v1/items`, {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: [
        {
          id: 1,
          name: 'Test Item 1',
          description: 'This is a test item',
          stockCount: 5,
        },
        {
          id: 2,
          name: 'Test Item 2',
          description: 'This is another test item',
          stockCount: 3,
        },
      ],
    }).as('getItems')
  })
```

Now for the magic trick: to generate Pact contracts, we simply replace `cy.intercept()` with `cy.pactIntercept()`. That's it! The API is nearly identical (seriously, it's almost too easy):

```typescript:src/App.cy.tsx
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.pactIntercept('GET', `v1/items`, {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: [
        {
          id: 1,
          name: 'Test Item 1',
          description: 'This is a test item',
          stockCount: 5,
        },
        {
          id: 2,
          name: 'Test Item 2',
          description: 'This is another test item',
          stockCount: 3,
        },
      ],
    }).as('getItems')
  })

  it('allows selecting quantity and buying items', () => {
    cy.pactIntercept('POST', `v1/purchase`, {
      statusCode: 200,
    }).as('purchase')

    cy.mount(<App />)
    cy.wait('@getItems')

    // Select quantity from dropdown
    cy.get('.ant-select').first().click()
    cy.get('.ant-select-item-option').contains('3').click()

    // Click buy button
    cy.get('button').contains('Buy Now').first().click()

    // Verify purchase request
    cy.wait('@purchase').its('request.body').should('deep.equal', {
      itemId: 1,
      quantity: 3,
    })
  })

  it('handles purchase errors correctly', () => {
    cy.pactIntercept('POST', `v1/purchase`, {
      statusCode: 500,
    }).as('purchaseError')

    cy.mount(<App />)
    cy.wait('@getItems')

    cy.get('button').contains('Buy Now').first().click()
    cy.get('.ant-alert-error').should('be.visible')
    cy.contains('Unable to complete purchase').should('be.visible')
  })
```

That's literally it! 🎉 The `cy.pactIntercept()` command automatically:
- Records the request/response interactions 
- Maintains the same behavior as `cy.intercept()` for your tests (your tests won't even notice the difference)

**Provider Name Configuration**: The provider name is typically inferred from the URL or can be configured in the plugin settings. Check the [pact-js-mock documentation](https://github.com/ludorival/pact-js-mock) for the latest configuration options. In many cases, you may need to configure the provider name explicitly:

```typescript:cypress.config.ts
setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
  return pactPlugin(on, config, {
    consumerName: 'shop-frontend',
    pactVersion: '4.0.0',
    // Additional configuration as needed
  });
}
```

### Step 5: Configure Pact Output 🎨

Want to customize things? Create a `pact.config.json` file (optional, but sometimes it's nice to have control):

```json:pact.config.json
{
  "consumer": {
    "name": "shop-frontend"
  },
  "pactDir": "./pacts",
  "pactSpecificationVersion": "4.0.0"
}
```

### Step 6: Run Tests and Generate Contracts 🏃

Time to see the magic happen! When you run your Cypress tests, Pact contracts will be automatically generated (no extra steps needed):

```bash
npm test
```

After running tests, you'll find the generated Pact contract in `pacts/shop-frontend-order-service.json` :

```json:pacts/shop-frontend-order-service.json
{
  "consumer": {
    "name": "shop-frontend"
  },
  "provider": {
    "name": "order-service"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "pactSpecification": {
      "version": "4.0.0"
    },
    "client": {
      "name": "pact-js-mock",
      "version": "0.5.0"
    }
  },
  "interactions": [
    {
      "description": "GET v1/items",
      "response": {
        "status": 200,
        "body": [
          {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "Test Item 1",
            "description": "This is a test item",
            "stockCount": 5
          },
          {
            "id": 2,
            "name": "Test Item 2",
            "description": "This is another test item",
            "stockCount": 3
          }
        ]
      },
      "request": {
        "method": "GET",
        "path": "/v1/items"
      }
    },
    {
      "description": "POST v1/purchase",
      "response": {
        "status": 200
      },
      "request": {
        "method": "POST",
        "path": "/v1/purchase",
        "body": {
          "itemId": 1,
          "quantity": 3
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```



### Step 7: Publish Contracts to Pact Broker 📤

Now let's share our contracts with the world (or at least with the Pact Broker)! Add scripts to your `package.json` to publish contracts:

> **Tip:** These scripts use the `$GIT_COMMIT` environment variable to track the version of the contracts being published. If it's not already set in your environment, you can set it to the latest Git commit hash with:
> 
> ```bash
> export GIT_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
> ```

```json:package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "cypress run --component",
    "pact:publish": "pact-broker publish ./pacts --broker-base-url=$PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL --broker-token=$PACT_BROKER_TOKEN --consumer-app-version=$GIT_COMMIT",
    "pact:can-i-deploy": "pact-broker can-i-deploy --broker-base-url=$PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL --broker-token=$PACT_BROKER_TOKEN --pacticipant=shop-frontend --version=$GIT_COMMIT"
  }
}
```


After running tests and generating contracts, publish them to the Pact Broker:

```bash
npm run pact:publish
```

Check your Pact Broker - you should see your contract there! 🎊



## 3. Implement Order Service Verifier ✅

Now let's make sure the order-service actually fulfills the contract. In the order-service project, create a Pact provider verification test. First, add the necessary dependencies:

**Maven (pom.xml):**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>au.com.dius.pact.provider</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit5</artifactId>
    <version>4.6.4</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>au.com.dius.pact.provider</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring</artifactId>
    <version>4.6.4</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle (build.gradle.kts):**
```kotlin
testImplementation("au.com.dius.pact.provider:junit5:4.6.4")
testImplementation("au.com.dius.pact.provider:spring:4.6.4")
```

Create a provider verification test:

```kotlin:src/test/kotlin/com/example/orderservice/pact/OrderServiceContractTest.kt
import au.com.dius.pact.provider.junit5.HttpTestTarget
import au.com.dius.pact.provider.junit5.PactVerificationContext
import au.com.dius.pact.provider.junit5.PactVerificationInvocationContextProvider
import au.com.dius.pact.provider.junitsupport.Provider
import au.com.dius.pact.provider.junitsupport.loader.PactBroker
import au.com.dius.pact.provider.junitsupport.loader.PactBrokerAuth
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach
import org.junit.jupiter.api.TestTemplate
import org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ExtendWith
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest
import org.springframework.test.context.junit.jupiter.SpringExtension

@ExtendWith(SpringExtension::class)
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.DEFINED_PORT)
@Provider("order-service")
@PactBroker(
    url = "\${PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL}",
    authentication = PactBrokerAuth(token = "\${PACT_BROKER_TOKEN}")
)
class OrderServiceContractTest {

    @TestTemplate
    @ExtendWith(PactVerificationInvocationContextProvider::class)
    fun pactVerificationTestTemplate(context: PactVerificationContext) {
        context.verifyInteraction()
    }

    @BeforeEach
    fun before(context: PactVerificationContext) {
        context.target = HttpTestTarget("localhost", 8080)
    }
}
```

Create a `src/test/resources/application.properties` file:

```properties:src/test/resources/application.properties
pact.verifier.publishResults=true
pact.provider.version=${GIT_COMMIT:local}
```

This test will:
1. Start your Spring Boot application 
2. Fetch contracts from the Pact Broker (getting the contracts...)
3. Verify that your application satisfies all consumer contracts (checking if you're keeping your promises)
4. Publish verification results back to the broker (sharing the good news - or bad news, if something's broken 😅)


## 4. Setup CI/CD Pipeline 🔄

Time to automate everything (because manual work is so last decade)! Update your CI/CD pipeline to run tests and publish contracts. Here's a complete GitHub Actions workflow (copy-paste friendly):

```yaml:.github/workflows/main.yml
name: CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
        env:
          GIT_COMMIT: ${{ github.sha }}

      - name: Publish Pact contracts
        if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        run: npm run pact:publish
        env:
          PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL: ${{ secrets.PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL }}
          PACT_BROKER_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PACT_BROKER_TOKEN }}
          GIT_COMMIT: ${{ github.sha }}

      - name: Check if can deploy
        if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        run: npm run pact:can-i-deploy
        env:
          PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL: ${{ secrets.PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL }}
          PACT_BROKER_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PACT_BROKER_TOKEN }}
          GIT_COMMIT: ${{ github.sha }}
```

**Important**: Make sure to add the following secrets to your GitHub repository (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):
- `PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL`: Your Pact Broker URL (e.g., `https://your-org.pactflow.io`)
- `PACT_BROKER_TOKEN`: Your Pact Broker API token (keep it secret, keep it safe! 🔐)

This ensures that:
1. Tests run on every push and pull request
2. Contracts are published to the broker after successful tests on main branch
3. Deployment is blocked if contracts are incompatible with provider services

## 5. Publish Contract between order-service and inventory-service 🔗

TODO point to the pull request raised by the AI agent
> **Reference Implementation**: See the complete working example in [order-service-pact-mock-demo](https://github.com/ludorival/order-service-pact-mock-demo)

Now let's do the same thing for the backend services! This time we're working with Kotlin/Java, but the concept is the same - convert your existing mocks to generate contracts.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies 📦

Add `pact-jvm-mock` dependencies to your `build.gradle.kts` or `pom.xml`. The library supports both MockK and Mockito (pick your favorite, we don't judge!):

**Gradle (build.gradle.kts):**
```kotlin
// For MockK
testImplementation("io.github.ludorival:pact-jvm-mock-mockk:1.4.0")

// OR for Mockito
testImplementation("io.github.ludorival:pact-jvm-mock-mockito:1.4.0")

// For Spring RestTemplate support
testImplementation("io.github.ludorival:pact-jvm-mock-spring:1.4.0")
```

**Maven (pom.xml):**
```xml
<!-- For MockK -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.ludorival</groupId>
    <artifactId>pact-jvm-mock-mockk</artifactId>
    <version>1.4.0</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>

<!-- OR for Mockito -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.ludorival</groupId>
    <artifactId>pact-jvm-mock-mockito</artifactId>
    <version>1.4.0</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>

<!-- For Spring RestTemplate support -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.ludorival</groupId>
    <artifactId>pact-jvm-mock-spring</artifactId>
    <version>1.4.0</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

### Step 2: Configure Pact ⚙️

Time to configure Pact! Create a `PactConfiguration` object to define your consumer and provider names. This is typically done as a Kotlin object or Java class:

**Kotlin:**
```kotlin:src/test/kotlin/com/example/orderservice/pact/InventoryServicePactConfig.kt
import io.github.ludorival.pactjvm.mock.PactConfiguration
import io.github.ludorival.pactjvm.mock.spring.SpringRestTemplateMockAdapter

object InventoryServicePactConfig : PactConfiguration(
    "inventory-service",  // Provider name
    SpringRestTemplateMockAdapter { providerName ->
        // Optional: Custom ObjectMapper configuration
        // Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder().build()
    }
)
```

**Note**: The consumer name is typically inferred from your project name or can be configured via system properties. Check the [pact-jvm-mock documentation](https://github.com/ludorival/pact-jvm-mock) for consumer name configuration options.

**Java:**
```java:src/test/java/com/example/orderservice/pact/InventoryServicePactConfig.java
import io.github.ludorival.pactjvm.mock.PactConfiguration;
import io.github.ludorival.pactjvm.mock.spring.SpringRestTemplateMockAdapter;

public class InventoryServicePactConfig extends PactConfiguration {
    public InventoryServicePactConfig() {
        super("inventory-service", new SpringRestTemplateMockAdapter());
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Convert Existing Mockito/MockK Tests 🔄

Here's the fun part! `pact-jvm-mock` works with existing Mockito or MockK mocks. Here's how to convert your existing tests (spoiler: it's easier than you think):

**Before (Existing Test with Mockito):**
```kotlin:src/test/kotlin/com/example/orderservice/service/InventoryClientTest.kt
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension::class)
class InventoryClientTest {
    
    @Mock
    lateinit var restTemplate: RestTemplate
    
    @InjectMocks
    lateinit var inventoryClient: InventoryClient

    @Test
    fun `should check product availability`() {
        val productId = "12345"
        val expectedResponse = ProductAvailability(productId, 42)
        
        `when`(restTemplate.getForEntity(
            eq("http://inventory-service/inventory/products/$productId"),
            eq(ProductAvailability::class.java)
        )).thenReturn(ResponseEntity.ok(expectedResponse))

        val result = inventoryClient.checkAvailability(productId)
        
        assertThat(result.quantity).isEqualTo(42)
    }
}
```

**After (With Pact Contract Generation using Mockito):**
```kotlin:src/test/kotlin/com/example/orderservice/service/InventoryClientTest.kt
import io.github.ludorival.pactjvm.mock.mockito.EnablePactMock
import io.github.ludorival.pactjvm.mock.mockito.PactMockito.uponReceiving
import org.mockito.ArgumentMatchers.any
import org.mockito.ArgumentMatchers.eq
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
import org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ExtendWith
import org.mockito.junit.jupiter.MockitoExtension
import org.mockito.Mock
import org.mockito.InjectMocks

@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension::class)
@EnablePactMock(InventoryServicePactConfig::class)
class InventoryClientTest {
    
    @Mock
    lateinit var restTemplate: RestTemplate
    
    @InjectMocks
    lateinit var inventoryClient: InventoryClient

    @Test
    fun `should check product availability`() {
        val productId = "12345"
        val expectedResponse = ProductAvailability(productId, 42)
        
        uponReceiving(
            restTemplate.getForEntity(
                any(String::class.java),
                eq(ProductAvailability::class.java)
            )
        ).thenReturn(ResponseEntity.ok(expectedResponse))

        val result = inventoryClient.checkAvailability(productId)
        
        assertThat(result.quantity).isEqualTo(42)
    }
}
```

**Alternative: Using MockK (Kotlin DSL):**
```kotlin:src/test/kotlin/com/example/orderservice/service/InventoryClientTest.kt
import io.github.ludorival.pactjvm.mock.mockk.EnablePactMock
import io.github.ludorival.pactjvm.mock.mockk.uponReceiving
import io.mockk.mockk
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test

@EnablePactMock(InventoryServicePactConfig::class)
class InventoryClientTest {
    
    private val restTemplate = mockk<RestTemplate>()
    private val inventoryClient = InventoryClient(restTemplate)

    @Test
    fun `should check product availability`() {
        val productId = "12345"
        val expectedResponse = ProductAvailability(productId, 42)
        
        uponReceiving {
            restTemplate.getForEntity(any<String>(), ProductAvailability::class.java)
        } returns ResponseEntity.ok(expectedResponse)

        val result = inventoryClient.checkAvailability(productId)
        
        assertThat(result.quantity).isEqualTo(42)
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Customize Descriptions and Provider States

You can customize the interaction description and add provider states:

**Kotlin (MockK):**
```kotlin
uponReceiving {
    restTemplate.getForEntity(any<String>(), ProductAvailability::class.java)
} withDescription { "get product availability by product ID" } given {
    state("product exists in inventory")
} returns ResponseEntity.ok(expectedResponse)
```

**Java (Mockito):**
```java
uponReceiving(restTemplate.getForEntity(any(String.class), eq(ProductAvailability.class)))
    .withDescription("Get product availability by product ID")
    .given(builder -> builder.state("product exists in inventory"))
    .thenReturn(ResponseEntity.ok(expectedResponse));
```

### How It Works 🧙

The `pact-jvm-mock` library is pretty clever:
- Annotate your test class with `@EnablePactMock(PactConfiguration::class)` to enable Pact recording
- Replaces your existing Mockito/MockK mocks with `uponReceiving()` (just swap the method calls!)
- Records all HTTP interactions made through Spring's `RestTemplate` (it's watching... 👀)
- Generates Pact contract files in `src/test/resources/pacts` by default
- Uses the test name as the interaction description (or custom description if provided)
- Maintains your existing test structure - just annotate the class and use `uponReceiving()` instead of `when()`/`every()` 

### Key Benefits 🎁

1. **Minimal changes**: Your test logic remains the same (no need to rewrite everything!)
2. **Familiar API**: Uses Mockito/MockK patterns you already know (no learning curve here)
3. **Automatic contract generation**: Contracts are created automatically when tests run (set it and forget it)
4. **Spring integration**: Works seamlessly with Spring's `RestTemplate`

For more advanced features like custom ObjectMapper, matching rules, and error handling, refer to the [pact-jvm-mock documentation](https://github.com/ludorival/pact-jvm-mock). There's always more to learn! 📚

### Step 5: Publish Contracts to Pact Broker 📤

After running your tests, Pact contract files will be generated in `src/test/resources/pacts` . To publish them to the Pact Broker, add a Maven or Gradle task:

**Maven (pom.xml):**
```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>au.com.dius.pact.provider</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven</artifactId>
    <version>4.6.4</version>
    <configuration>
        <pactBrokerUrl>${PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL}</pactBrokerUrl>
        <pactBrokerToken>${PACT_BROKER_TOKEN}</pactBrokerToken>
        <projectVersion>${GIT_COMMIT}</projectVersion>
        <pactDirectory>${project.build.directory}/pacts</pactDirectory>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

**Gradle (build.gradle.kts):**
```kotlin
plugins {
    id("au.com.dius.pact") version "4.6.4"
}

pact {
    publish {
        pactDirectory = "src/test/resources/pacts"
        pactBrokerUrl = System.getenv("PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL") ?: ""
        pactBrokerToken = System.getenv("PACT_BROKER_TOKEN") ?: ""
        consumerVersion = System.getenv("GIT_COMMIT") ?: "local"
    }
}
```

Then publish contracts with:
```bash
# Maven
./mvnw pact:publish

# Gradle
./gradlew pactPublish
```

## 6. Implement Inventory Service Verifier ✅

One more time! In the inventory-service project, create a similar Pact provider verification test (you're getting good at this!):

```kotlin:src/test/kotlin/com/example/inventoryservice/pact/InventoryServiceContractTest.kt
import au.com.dius.pact.provider.junit5.HttpTestTarget
import au.com.dius.pact.provider.junit5.PactVerificationContext
import au.com.dius.pact.provider.junit5.PactVerificationInvocationContextProvider
import au.com.dius.pact.provider.junitsupport.Provider
import au.com.dius.pact.provider.junitsupport.loader.PactBroker
import au.com.dius.pact.provider.junitsupport.loader.PactBrokerAuth
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach
import org.junit.jupiter.api.TestTemplate
import org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ExtendWith
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest
import org.springframework.test.context.junit.jupiter.SpringExtension

@ExtendWith(SpringExtension::class)
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.DEFINED_PORT)
@Provider("inventory-service")
@PactBroker(
    url = "\${PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL}",
    authentication = PactBrokerAuth(token = "\${PACT_BROKER_TOKEN}")
)
class InventoryServiceContractTest {

    @TestTemplate
    @ExtendWith(PactVerificationInvocationContextProvider::class)
    fun pactVerificationTestTemplate(context: PactVerificationContext) {
        context.verifyInteraction()
    }

    @BeforeEach
    fun before(context: PactVerificationContext) {
        context.target = HttpTestTarget("localhost", 8080)
    }
}
```

## 7. Setup CI/CD Pipeline for Backend Services 🔄

Let's automate the backend services too! Update the CI/CD pipeline for both order-service and inventory-service:

```yaml:.github/workflows/main.yml
name: CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Set up JDK
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          java-version: '17'
          distribution: 'temurin'
          
      - name: Build and Test
        run: ./mvnw verify
        env:
          PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL: ${{ secrets.PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL }}
          PACT_BROKER_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PACT_BROKER_TOKEN }}
          GIT_COMMIT: ${{ github.sha }}
        
      - name: Publish Pact contracts
        if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        run: |
          ./mvnw pact:publish
        env:
          PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL: ${{ secrets.PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL }}
          PACT_BROKER_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PACT_BROKER_TOKEN }}
          GIT_COMMIT: ${{ github.sha }}
        
      - name: Can I Deploy?
        if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        run: |
          curl -LO https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-ruby-standalone/releases/download/v1.88.3/pact-1.88.3-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
          tar xzf pact-1.88.3-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
          ./pact/bin/pact-broker can-i-deploy \
            --broker-base-url="${PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL}" \
            --broker-token="${PACT_BROKER_TOKEN}" \
            --pacticipant="${PACTICIPANT}" \
            --version="${GITHUB_SHA}"
        env:
          PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL: ${{ secrets.PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL }}
          PACT_BROKER_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PACT_BROKER_TOKEN }}
          PACTICIPANT: ${{ github.event.repository.name }}
          GIT_COMMIT: ${{ github.sha }}
```

**Note**: For Maven projects, you may need to add the Pact Maven plugin to publish contracts:

```xml:pom.xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>au.com.dius.pact.provider</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven</artifactId>
    <version>4.6.4</version>
    <configuration>
        <pactBrokerUrl>${PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL}</pactBrokerUrl>
        <pactBrokerToken>${PACT_BROKER_TOKEN}</pactBrokerToken>
        <projectVersion>${GIT_COMMIT}</projectVersion>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

## 8. Test a Breaking Change from Frontend 💥

Time to break things (on purpose, of course)! Let's simulate a breaking change in the frontend by modifying the expected response structure. This is where contract testing really shines - it catches these issues before they hit production:

```typescript:src/App.cy.tsx
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.pactIntercept('GET', `v1/items`, {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: [
        {
          id: 1,
          name: 'Test Item 1',
          description: 'This is a test item',
          stock: 5, // Changed from stockCount to stock (BREAKING CHANGE)
        },
      ],
    }).as('getItems')
  })
```

When you run tests and publish the new contract, the order-service's contract verification will fail because:
1. The new contract expects a `stock` field (but wait, there's more...)
2. The order-service still returns `stockCount` (oops! 😬)
3. The Pact verifier detects this mismatch and fails the build (caught red-handed!)

This prevents deploying incompatible changes to production! Your CI/CD pipeline just saved you from a production incident. You're welcome! 🎉

## 9. Test a Breaking Change from Order Service 💥

Let's do it again, but this time from the other direction! Similarly, let's simulate a breaking change in the order-service's contract with inventory-service (breaking things is fun when it's intentional!):

```kotlin:src/test/kotlin/com/example/orderservice/service/InventoryClientTest.kt
@EnablePactMock(InventoryServicePactConfig::class)
class InventoryClientTest {
    // ... existing setup ...

    @Test
    fun `should check product availability`() {
        val productId = "12345"
        val expectedResponse = ProductAvailability(productId, stock = 42) // Changed from quantity to stock (BREAKING CHANGE)
        
        uponReceiving {
            restTemplate.getForEntity(any<String>(), ProductAvailability::class.java)
        } returns ResponseEntity.ok(expectedResponse)

        val result = inventoryClient.checkAvailability(productId)
        
        assertThat(result.stock).isEqualTo(42) // Updated assertion
    }
}
```

When the order-service publishes this new contract, the inventory-service's contract verification will fail because:
1. The new contract expects a `stock` field in the response (expecting one thing...)
2. The inventory-service still returns `quantity` (but getting another!)
3. The Pact verifier detects this mismatch and fails the build (busted! 🚨)

This ensures that breaking changes are caught early in the development cycle (before your users notice, which is always a good thing!).

## 10. Conclusion 🎊

Congratulations! You made it to the end! 🎉 By leveraging existing mocks in our tests, we've successfully implemented contract testing with Pact without rewriting our test suite. This approach offers several key benefits:

1. **Zero additional test code**: Existing tests automatically become contract tests (more value, less work!)
2. **Single source of truth**: Mocks are defined once, contracts generated automatically (DRY principle, achieved!)
3. **Gradual adoption**: Teams can start with existing tests and expand coverage over time (no big bang migration needed)
4. **Developer-friendly**: No need to learn Pact DSL; use familiar mocking libraries (use what you know!)
5. **AI-assisted**: Modern AI agents can help accelerate the conversion process (the future is now! 🤖)

### Key Takeaways 📝

Here's what you should remember (the TL;DR version):
- **Frontend**: Use `pact-js-mock` with `cy.pactIntercept()` to convert Cypress mocks (just swap the method name!)
- **Backend**: Use `pact-jvm-mock` with `@EnablePactMock` annotation and `uponReceiving()` to convert Mockito/MockK tests with Spring RestTemplate (annotate and go!)
- **Provider Verification**: Use standard Pact JVM provider verification for Spring Boot applications (prove you're keeping your promises)
- **CI/CD**: Integrate contract publishing and verification into your pipeline (automate all the things!)
- **Breaking Changes**: Contract testing catches incompatible changes before deployment (safety net activated! 🛡️)

### Next Steps 🚀

Ready to implement this in your own projects? Here's your roadmap:
1. Start with your existing test mocks and convert them incrementally (baby steps, you've got this!)
2. Set up Pact Broker (or use PactFlow) for contract management (choose your adventure)
3. Integrate contract verification into your CI/CD pipeline (automation is your friend)
4. Use AI agents to accelerate the conversion process (let the robots help!)
5. Monitor contract compatibility across service boundaries (keep an eye on things 👀)

Remember: you don't have to do everything at once. Start small, iterate, and expand as you get comfortable!
